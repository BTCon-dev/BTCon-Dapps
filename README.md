# BTCon-Dapps
DApps for BTCon (BTCO), a Bitcoin-like utility token on TON. First app: a swap UI with Telegram Wallet &amp; Tonkeeper support. Designed for simulations, Web3 tools, and educational use ‚Äî not backed or bridged.

ü™ô BTCon DApps ‚Äì Decentralized Applications for the BTCon Token on TON
This repository hosts a growing suite of decentralized applications (DApps) built specifically for BTCon (BTCO) ‚Äî a utility token on the TON blockchain. The BTCon token is designed to mirror the approximate value of Bitcoin (BTC), without relying on any wrapped asset, bridge, or collateral backing. Instead, it serves as a simulated BTC reference that is ideal for educational tools, blockchain experiments, test environments, and gamified Web3 applications.

The token is not redeemable for real BTC and should not be considered a financial asset. Its purpose is to enable developers, learners, and enthusiasts to build and test systems where a BTC-like value is useful ‚Äî without the risk, complexity, or cost associated with real Bitcoin integration.

üîÅ First DApp: BTCon Swap
The first DApp in this repository is a simple and elegant swap interface for BTCon, allowing users to simulate token exchange using Telegram Wallet and Tonkeeper. This DApp includes:

Direct wallet connection (TON Connect)

BTCon logo and metadata support

Swap UI with input and estimated TON value

Responsive layout optimized for web and mobile

Footer with placeholders for Instagram, X (Twitter), Website, and Telegram Bot

The Swap app is designed to be modular and forkable, making it easy for developers to build upon or integrate into other Web3 tools.

üöÄ Roadmap
Planned additions to this repository include:

BTCon staking contracts and frontends

Portfolio dashboard to track simulated BTC balances

Leaderboards and gamification tools for community engagement

Integration with other TON-based DApps and testnets

This repository is intended to grow into a central hub for all BTCon-related Web3 experiments. All code is open source and MIT-licensed ‚Äî feel free to contribute, fork, or suggest features.
